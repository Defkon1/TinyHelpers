A collection of helper methods and classes for ASP.NET Core that I use everyday. I have packed them in a single library to avoid code duplication.

**Installation**

The library is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TinyHelpers.AspNetCore). Just search *TinyHelpers.AspNetCore* in the **Package Manager GUI** or run the following command in the **Package Manager Console**:

    Install-Package TinyHelpers.AspNetCore

**Contribute**
